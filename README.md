# Master Project 2025
V20240606

Welcome to the Writing Master Project. This master project is a collection of templates, and reworks that I’ve had over the years, and thought that it would be beneficial to people people who are Architects and Gardeners alike. I tried to design this template as best I can for organization since my previous attempt at this was completely bloated to say the least.
It goes without saying that without the wonderful writers and template designers, this master project wouldn’t have been possible. Make sure to support the original authors!

## Explained
The template is divided into 7 main parts: Novel, Series, Story, Poem, Journal, Research, and Templates. Each of them serve a specific purpose. Mind you, you can simple delete these extract folders if you don’t want them in your project. They are just here for simple organization of the types of prose that an author might want to work on.
